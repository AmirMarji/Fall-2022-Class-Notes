### What your computer experience has been so far. Include any interesting projects that you've worked on or interesting courses you've taken?

here is a quick compilation with some of the things I know about computers (chronilogicly unorginized)

- BOCES CTI computer hardware and computer networking classes (including Testout Cirtifications for hardware, networking and linux)
- various java experince with all of the CS classes from both dutchess and New Paltz.
- LAMP Stack (Linux Apache MySQL PHP)

I dont relally have many projects =under my belt, but one does come to mind

it is called [Cooking-Website-Script](https://github.com/AmirMarji/Cooking-Website-Script)

its a small script I wrote in python that asks a bunch of questions in regards to a cooking recipie and generates a HTML and CSS file which is a **_Website-ified_** version of the recipie. it has light and darkmode and a print function too. It is a very small program, but it is intresting to me becuase this was the first time that I wrote something wihtout the guidence of a course. i'm geniunly proud of it.

In terms of intresting courses, the Software engeniring class taught by Tony Denizard was a great one, it forced me and 5 others to leran LAMP and make a web application. We made an EHR, and I thought it turned out well. we all got an A- in the class so that's something. here is a link bellow

### Where do you see yourself using what you learn in this course?

With this course I would like the following outcomes for myself

1. learn Frontend web evelopment with a javascript framework
   - I wasnt really involved with the frontend of the Web App mentioned above. so I do hope to ot only do more frontend, but also learn how to do it with a front end javascript frmaework becasue everone is doing that now.

2. Learn the Model View Controller framewrok
   - with this knowlege, I want to learn more Laravel or Ruby on Ralls, so I can create more and more Webapps

3. Be motivated and informed on how to start and finish web application development
   - I suffer alot with procrastination. I **_MUST_** know everything or I do nothing (or atleast delay). I do hope with the knowlege I gain from this course, I will be motified to do more.
